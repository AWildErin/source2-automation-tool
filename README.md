# Source 2 Automation Tool
Source 2 Automation Tool is a program inspired by Chaos Initiative's CAS but for Source 2. Specifically s&amp;box, but I plan on supporting other games

## How do I use it?
Currently I'm working on some docs for it. As of right now, the application is a command line program, but in the future I plan on creating a GUI version of it, for those who don't want to manually edit config files or want to just see a visual representation of things.
